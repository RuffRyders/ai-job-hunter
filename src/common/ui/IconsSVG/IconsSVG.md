These icons are sourced from google material icons collection, but any SVG works.

1. Get raw SVG from [Google](https://fonts.google.com/icons) or elsewhere.
2. Use [react-svgr.com](https://react-svgr.com/playground/) to generate React component code.
3. Paste into project file.
4. Add SVGComponent type annotation.
